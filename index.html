		<h2>Title: Stan</h2>
		<p>Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin 
			I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom 
			I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em 
			There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin 
			Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em 
			but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter? 
			My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father 
			If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? 
			I'ma name her Bonnie 
			I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry 
			I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him 
			I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan 
			I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam 
			I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man 
			I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat 
			Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, 
			just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan 
			This is Stan 
		</p>
		<p class="chorus-part">Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance 
			I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans 
			If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert 
			you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew 
			That's my little brother man, he's only six years old 
			We waited in the blistering cold for you, 
			four hours and you just said, "No." 
			That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol 
			He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do 
			I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to 
			Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you 
			you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way 
			I never knew my father neither; 
			he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her 
			I can relate to what you're saying in your songs 
			so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on 
			cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed 
			I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest 
			Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds 
			It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me 
			See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it 
			My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7 
			But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does 
			She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up 
			You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose 
			Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S. 
			We should be together too 
		</p>
		<p>
			Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy 
			You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? 
			Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that 
			and here's an autograph for your brother, 
			I wrote it on the Starter cap 
			I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you 
			Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you 
			But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? 
			I say that shit just clownin dogg, 
			c'mon - how fucked up is you? 
			You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling 
			to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some 
			And what's this shit about us meant to be together? 
			That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other 
			I really think you and your girlfriend need each other 
			or maybe you just need to treat her better 
			I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time 
			before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine 
			if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan 
			why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan 
			I just don't want you to do some crazy shit 
			I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick 
			Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge 
			and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid 
			and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to 
			Come to think about, his name was.. it was you 
			Damn!
